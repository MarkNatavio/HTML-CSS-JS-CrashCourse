This is an introductory crash course to web development. In it I will explore and explain how the internet works as well as how to build a website.

Why web development?
======================
Web development is one of the largest industries out there. A web developer gets payed anywhere between $51,100/yr - $100,670/yr with a mean salary of $77,030. 
That is well above the average salary in the United States, so it is quite a stable job.

On top of that, there is high job security as almost every company needs a website for various reasons: advertisement, selling, and discoverability. 

Finally, this is a well adaptable field that can lead to database engineering and management, mobile development, and more.

Now, there are websites made to help people build their own websites so why do we need web developers?
Simply put, because those websites are extremely limited and having a developer who is capable of designing a unique website for your needs sets companies apart.

With that being said, lets look at how it works.



The internet
==============
The internet is a network of billions of machines connected to one another.
It has provided us with the most revolutionary means of communication, by means of mass access to any and all infromation. But how does it work?

The internet was first released in 1983 thanks to the establishment of the Internet Protocol Suite (IPS), which standardizes how computers communicate with one another.
It is made up of:
• Application (HTTP, SMTP, FTP)
• Transport (TCP, UDP)
• Network (IP)
• Data Link (Physical Devices)

Each computer has its own unique internet protocol (IP) address that is used to identify them in the Network.

The computers can then send data back and forth with the transmition control protocol (TCP), which breaks down the data into packages and sends the data through physical devices.

The recieving computer then takes the packaged adta and puts it back together.

The internet is the hardware while the world wide web (www) is the software behing it.

The web allows people to access a website with the hypertext transfer prototocol (HTTP), which provides each website its own unique uniform resource locator (URL).

We typically use a browser, aka the client, to access a website.
At the other end of the URL is a server, which recieves an HTTP GET request from the client and sends back a response containing the content.



Domain Names
==============
Every website has its own unique domain name, which is handled by non-profit organizations.



How do websites work?
=======================
Websites are made up of two portions:
• Front-end: the design of the graphical user interface/user experience (UI/UX)
• Back-end: the conection to the data layer of the application

Websites are made up of three languages and as such, this beginner crash course is split into three sections:
1) HTML
2) CSS
3) JavaScript

Simply put, if a website was a house
HTML would be the walls, window holes, and doorways
CSS would be the furniture, decoration, paint job, wall paper, insulation, windows and doors
JavaScript would be the piping, electricity, wifi, and heating


Getting started
=================
Before you continue, make sure you have a proper text editor.
I recommend Visual Studio Code as it provides a variety of extensions that are useful for web development such as Live Server and Prettier - Code Formatter

Live Server provides an option on the bottom right of the visual studio code window that allow us to host the website in our computer and updates the website after every save.
This way we can quickly see what the website looks like and how it is formatted

Prettier just makes it so everytime we save an .html file, it will automatically format itself and make it easier to read.

Now, begin with the HTML tutorial, then CSS, and end with the JavaScript tutorial.
